# --- Line Ending Normalization ---
#
# This section ensures consistent line endings across different operating systems.
# 'text=auto' tells Git to handle line endings automatically, converting to LF on
# commit and to the platform's native line ending on checkout.
# 'eol=lf' forces line endings for all recognized text files to be LF (Linux style).
# This is generally preferred for web projects to ensure consistency with Unix-based
# servers and build environments.

* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Binary File Handling ---
#
# This section marks common binary file types, instructing Git not to
# attempt text-based diffs or merges on them. This prevents corruption
# and improves performance for these files.
